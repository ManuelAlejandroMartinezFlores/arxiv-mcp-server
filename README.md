To execute this MCP server, clone the repository or downlad the zip file. It is recommended to use `uv` for package management (the requierments can be found on `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`). Then use the following parameters when configuring this MCP using Anthropic's SDK<br>
```json
{
  "command": "uv",
  "args": [
    "run", "--repository", "PATH/TO/REPO", "PATH/TO/REPO/arxiv_mcp_server.py"
  ]
}
```
Moreover, the user should specify the default path for pdf downloads in the `.env` file 
```env
DOWNLOAD_ROOT = 'PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD/PDF'
```
